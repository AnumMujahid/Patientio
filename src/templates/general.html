                   Aim of Inter Services Selection Board is to select potential officers for the defence forces of Pakistan who have 
the requisite capabilities to successfully complete their course of training at the military academies and also 
possess physical, mental, social and dynamic qualities to make successful leaders during peace and war.

Inter Services Selection Board caters for selection of candidates for training as potential officers for all the 
three services of Pakistan. Services Headquarters, however, plan the total number of candidates to be 
tested/inducted in various courses as per their overall requirement/schedule.

respective fields, administer these tests.
